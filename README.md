## Description

Certainly! Here's a description of the code structure outlined above:

1. `CalculatorApplication.java`: This is the main class that serves as the entry point for your Spring Boot application.

2. `controller/CalculatorController.java`: This class contains the controller logic for handling API endpoints. It receives incoming requests, invokes the appropriate service methods, and returns the response.

3. `dto/AccountsRequestDTO.java`, `dto/ArithmeticRequestDTO.java`, `dto/ScientificRequestDTO.java`: These classes represent the request payloads (DTOs) for the corresponding operations. They define the structure and properties of the data expected in the request body.

4. `model/AccountsResponse.java`, `model/ArithmeticResponse.java`, `model/ScientificResponse.java`, `model/SimpleInterestResponse.java`: These classes represent the response models for the corresponding operations. They define the structure and properties of the data returned in the response body.

5. `service/CalculatorService.java`: This interface defines the contract for the calculator service. It declares the methods to be implemented for performing various calculations.

6. `service/CalculatorServiceImpl.java`: This class implements the `CalculatorService` interface. It contains the actual business logic for performing arithmetic, scientific, and accounts operations.

7. `pom.xml`: The Project Object Model (POM) file for Maven. It includes the dependencies and plugins required for building and running the Spring Boot application.

8. `README.md`: This is a text file that provides information and instructions for using and setting up your API. It can include details about the API's purpose, installation instructions, API documentation, example requests and responses, and any other relevant information.
